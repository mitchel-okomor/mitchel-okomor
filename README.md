### Hi there,
 I'm Mitchel Okomor ðŸ‘‹
A Passionate Full-Stack Developer with proven ability in optimizing web funtional that improves data retrieval and workflow efficiency.

One thing i'm most concern about is the sense of duty when i am assigned a task, i feel obligated to complete it especially if it entails problem solving, research or building something new.

I am currently working as a front-end engineer, my motivation is to use my web development skills to develop result driven apps which offers maximum business solutions and sustained clients satisfaction. 
When i am not coding i learn how to play the piano, watch football or play video games.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my teaching young people how to code...
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Backend development
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any interesting project that involves NodeJS.
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with system design and design patterns.
